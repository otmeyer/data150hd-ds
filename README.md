# Olivia Meyer's COLL 150 Human Development & Data Science Repository  

Hi everyone! My name is Olivia and I'm a freshman at the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia. I'm originally from New York City, and I'm interested in majoring in Psychology with a minor in Data Science. I've decided to take Human Development & Data
Science as my COLL 150 to get a basic introduction to the more technological side of data science. This repository houses my work for the class.
