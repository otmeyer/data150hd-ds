# data150hd-ds - Olivia Meyer

Hi everyone! I'm a student at the College of William & Mary. I'm originally from New York City, and I'm interested in majoring in Psychology with a minor in Data Science. I've decided to take Human Development & Data Science as my COLL 150 to get a basic introduction to the more technological side of data science. This repository houses my work for the class.
