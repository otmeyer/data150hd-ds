My educational background includes statistics and research, so I have always thought of data science as a form of analysis. I agree that data science is a set of tools applied to a specific domain to uncover insights and patterns. I want to major in psychology, with a minor in data science, and eventually go into law. Psychology is a field of science which means that there is a ton of research and analysis done; data science is a crucial part of examining data and operationalizing those details. The combination of science and law is odd to a lot of people because it is merging a career that is very linguistic with a degree in something that is very scientific and mathematical. However, I think that majoring in psychology and then also pursuing data science helps a lot with the investigative side of being a lawyer. Having mastery of psychology could aid in understanding a personâ€™s motives and behaviors, which is indescribably important when needing to prove intent, and then knowledge of data science can be used to piece together and analyze how the evidence relates to your case.
